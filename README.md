# Route-Runner

A frontend-only web application simulating real-time vehicle movement and route tracking on an interactive map. Developed as an internship assignment, this project showcases proficiency in modern web development, mapping library integration (Leaflet.js), data visualization, and responsive UI design.

Key Features:
* Dynamic Map Display: Leverages Leaflet.js to render an interactive map with a custom visual theme.
* Simulated Live Tracking: A custom vehicle marker animates smoothly along a predefined route loaded from local JSON data.
* Progressive Route Drawing: The vehicle's historical path is dynamically drawn and extended as a polyline in real-time.
* Intuitive Playback Controls: Includes play, pause, reset, and adjustable speed controls for the simulation.
* Real-time Metadata Display: Provides live updates on current coordinates, elapsed time, and calculated vehicle speed.
* Responsive & Visually Enhanced UI: Designed to deliver a seamless and aesthetically pleasing experience across desktop and mobile browsers, featuring a subtle background animation.

Technologies Used:
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
* Leaflet.js (Mapping Library)
